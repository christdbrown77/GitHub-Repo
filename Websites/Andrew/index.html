            <h3>Hearing Aids – Do you know what you are paying for?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>At first glance hearing aid prices can appear to be expensive however once the cost of the hearing aids are divided by the approximate life span that they are expected to last and worn they can be the equivalent to most mobile phone contracts.  The main difference being that the payment of hearing aids is made in full at the time of fitting.  </p>
            <p>It is important to remember that hearing aids are worn continuously throughout the day, 365 days a year, and that the price includes the professional service of the hearing professional to provide an aftercare service for as long as you wish to avail of it.  At the Hearing Health Clinic, we are always open, honest, and clear with our information and that applies to our charges for hearing aid technology. </p>
            <p>This gives you the opportunity to compare technology options (where possible not all providers disclose their prices), and although you will still need to attend an appointment so the hearing professional can help you figure out what technology is most appropriate to your life style and budget, the ability to compare technology options will ensure you are getting the best value for your investment.  </p>
